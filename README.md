# Ghostchat

Ghostchat is an optionally-anonymous, self-destructing group-chat application built in ruby.

Create a group and preset how long the group will exist for - options can be as little as 5 minutes or as long as 24 hours. After the set amount of time expires, all users, and messages within a group are automatically (and permanently) destroyed. By default anyone can join a group simply by navigating to an existing groups unique url - however you can also easily password protect a group so that it is invite only.
